        <h2>Early Life & Education</h2>
        <p>On the 11th day of November 1947, our beloved mother and wife embarked on a remarkable journey that took her
            to various places, shaping her life and career.</p>
        <p>She was born in Winneba in the Central Region of the Republic of Ghana to her parents Ebenezer Nkrumah Affran and Florence Ghartey,
             who are all deceased. She was born into a family that was deeply rooted in traditional Ghanaian
            values and the Christian faith. She was the second child among six children.</p>
        <p>Her educational journey began at Wesley Girls High School, where she completed secondary education up to Form 4. And later went to KNUST for her masters to pursue MSc Finance and Accounting. This
            foundation laid the groundwork for her future endeavors.</p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>Nancy began her professional life at the Council for Scientific and Medical Research, where he honed her
            skills in scientific research. In her quest to expand his expertise, she traveled to Holland to study Animal
            Husbandry. There, he gained valuable expertise, knowledge, and experience in animal husbandry.</p>
        <p>Upon returning to Ghana, he joined the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB) as a farm manager, a role that
            allowed him to apply his acquired knowledge and expertise in animal husbandry and management.</p>

        <h2>Entrepreneurial Spirit</h2>
        <p>Driven by a passion for entrepreneurship, Welford ventured into farming by acquiring large parcels of land in
            Gbawe, Accra, where he reared animals on a large scale. His dedication and hard work led to the farm's
            success and growth, showcasing his ability to manage and grow a business while creating employment
            opportunities for many young men and women.</p>
        <p>Known affectionately as "Addotse" by the people of Gbawe, he diversified his entrepreneurial interests by
            starting a transportation business, demonstrating his versatility and adaptability. He continued his farm
            and transportation businesses for most of his life until retirement.</p>

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>Welford was family-oriented. He married and had eight children whom he nurtured from childbirth to maturity.
            He was also blessed with several grandchildren and great-grandchildren. A devoted father and grandfather, he
            will forever be remembered for his unwavering support and guidance, infectious sense of humor, and
            unshakeable optimism.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Throughout his life, Welford demonstrated a commitment to personal growth, professional development, and
            community contribution. His remarkable life is a testament to perseverance and resilience. His contributions
            to agriculture, research, and community development have left a lasting impact.</p>
        <p>Though he has departed to be with his maker, today we celebrate and honor his legacy and a life well-lived.
