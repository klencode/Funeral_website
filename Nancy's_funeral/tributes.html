            <h2 style="color: #3498db;">Tribute by favorite hand bag</h2>
            <p>Mama loved to take walks. I would always go with her if I knew she was going on a walk. I've cried because she went on a walk and didn't let me know. She always knew where she was going. Most times, I didn't.  She would pretend we were lost until I would see something that made the area familiar. If there was a steep hill, mama never made us find flat land, we climbed the hill. She would say there is something to be held on to on that steep hill so keep climbing, and hold on to what you need to hold on to. If we descended a steep hill, she would walk down easy, and there'd be me crying at the top, then she'd tell me to sit my butt down and drag myself to the end.
            </p>
            <p>She would always say that if you passed behind someone's house, and heard words of advice, take it, take the good and leave the bad. Mama always turned her children to God. If I was sick, the first thing was to pray, or do the sign of cross. If I called her saying "Mama me yafun y3 me yaw" the first question she would ask is "ay3 sign of cross?" 
            </p>
            <p>Growing up, I talked in my sleep, Mama told me to tell God to help me stop. She taught me what it was like to have childlike faith. She was a disciplinarian. I remember hiding the cane from her so she wouldn't find it. What is a cane when Nancy Affran has her hands? She showed love to all. She gave so much; I had a problem with it until I finally understood that that was the right thing to do. She never closed her door to anyone. She would greet even a stranger with a smile. She was always there when you needed her. I remember her taking something out of the freezer one time, while I was leaning over the sofa. I fell, hitting my head, but like the flash, she was there so fast picking me off the floor, laying me on the sofa, and placing ice on my head. I told my mother I missed hearing the cock crow in the morning, the next day, she sent me a voice note of the cock crowing. I wanted to hear the Muslim call for prayer in the morning, well, the cockcrow was louder than that, but she still tried. Her tongue always had blessings rolling off it. I would always wake up with a Bible verse sent from my mother and words of blessings. All I had to do was text "mama" and she would call me. In senior high school, I rarely called home. I called mama two weeks to when I had to come on break, after a whole semester in school. Going from hearing my mother's voice every day to not hearing it for a while, and then hearing it again, I cried. She asked me why, and if anyone was bullying me, I said no, and that I hadn't heard from her in a long time, she said "oh Kor-kordai, we're all doing well by God's grace"
            </p>
            <p>Before she came for my graduation, I told my host mum I was not going to cry, but the moment I saw her, I cried, I missed my mother, I cried even more when she left to return to Ghana. Throughout her stay, she would give wise words. She made light soup for me because I said I missed her Light soup. For some reason there was always light soup when I was sick, growing up. Her last words to me were words of blessings. I wanted to video call her, I always did, she said "NO" and it sounded like it was said in capital letters with an exclamation mark. After saying no, she softly said "Nyame nka wo ho, ne Nyame ntena" 
                Her great reminder, whatever the situation God is in charge.
                As Mama always said, "with Christ in the vessel, we will smile at the storm"

            <h2 style="color: #3498db;">Tribute by Friends</h2>
            <p>VIDA, FLORENCE AND NANCY</p>
            <p>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law. Romans 13:10 (KJV)</p>
            <p>We are saddened by the passing of our beloved mother but we are very thankful to God for granting her a
                fulfilled life. We are in tune with the hymnist in MHB 377 that “whatever my lot, thou has taught me to
                say it is well with my soul”.</p>
            <p>Mommy, we were fortunate to have you as our mother. Growing up, we all witnessed your desire and focus on
                giving us a proper education. The inspection of our uniforms to check cleanliness after school to ensure
                that our focus was ultimately in the classroom.</p>
            <p>Mommy, you were a total disciplinarian. You shaped our lives with your regular behavioral checks and
                reminded us to never forget our roots and always be respectful and humble. By your hard work,
                compassion, and dedication, you demonstrated to us that anything is possible once you put your mind to
                it.</p>
            <p>Most of all, you were a loving mother. You put in a lot of work to keep your children together. We fondly
                remember those Christmas days when we all sat around the round table in the compound and shared soft
                drinks and biscuits and played around the compound. Mommy, you taught us so much and we are very thankful for having you as our mother.
            </p>
            <p>As difficult as we have to watch you go meet your maker, we are comforted that you are in a better place
                and nodding your head in approval. You may have gone but certainly not forgotten. Our goodbyes today are
                not forever and not the end but simply mean we would miss you till we meet again.</p>

            <!-- <p>To our beloved Father-in-law Welford Anum Mensah.</p> -->
            <p>James Victor Obuama Addy</p>
            <p>Today, we celebrate the extraordinary life you lived. Marriage brings families together as expected but
                ours was not a mere saying but one born out of love and affection. Our mother-in-law welcomed each one
                of us into the family without any reservations.</p>
            <p>She inspired us with his kindness, wisdom, and love. She was always willing and available to offer words of
                encouragement whenever needed. Her presence was indeed felt in our lives. We will always remember all
                that you did for the family.</p>
            <p>She took keen interest in the welfare of her grandchild, she showed him love and made him happy
                whenever he was with her. We are honored and privileged to have known such a great person like you.
            </p>
            <p>Although you are no longer with us physically, we take comfort in the memories we shared together. We are
                comforted knowing that you are in a better place away from all the tribulations on earth. You will
                forever remain in our hearts, Grandma as we affectionately called you. We will cherish and always remember
                the time we spent with you. Rest in peace in the bosom of the Almighty God.</p>

        <!-- Tribute by Church -->
        <section class="tribute-section">
            <h2 style="color: #3498db;">Tribute by Church</h2>
            <p>“Everything that happens in this world happens at the time God chooses. He sets the time for birth and
                the time for death..........” (Ecclesiastes 3:1&2 GNB)</p>
            <p>The late Sister and mother. Nancy Affran Addy joined Ebenezer Methodist Church, in 2015 from Mt. Olivet Society. Upon
                joining the church, she joined Sis Ivy Otoo&apos;s Bible Class, now the Acts bible Class and immediately
                requested for a tithe book to enable her pay her tithes. Though she joined the church when she was in her
                old age, she was regular at church services.</p>
                <p>Sis. Nancy Addy was a simple and modest person, she was a man of few words and you would always find
                her seated quietly when he comes for church services. Not long after he joined the church, due to old
                age and health challenges, she was not able to make it for church services but the Rev Minister and
                Stewards visited her to pray for her and administer to her the communion and she was always looking
                forward to that visit.</p>
            <p>On Wednesday the 18th of September 2024, the Rev Minister and the steward visited her, administered to
                her the communion and prayed for her, then on Wednesday 25th of September 2024, the news of her death
                reached us. Little did they know that was the last time they were seeing Mrs. Nancy Affran Addy.</p>
            <p>We offer our sincere condolences to her husband, children, siblings, family, friends, and associates and all
                who are closer to her. We believe Mrs. Addy is taking a well-deserved rest in the bosom of Her creator
                where there is no more pain, no more sorrow and no more worries. Let us not weep as people without hope
                but rather rejoice with the belief that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will bring
                with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in Him. Farewell our beloved 
                Sis. Nancy Affran Addy, and may
                your soul rest in perfect peace till we meet again.</p>

            <p>`ELEGY BY T.N.T.T ADDY GRANDSON</p>
            <p>If my mouth could have the words to speak rather than to babble out this is what id say to celebrate you Granma Kk
                The earth is quiet, the skies weep softly for mama Kk, my beloved grand mother now sleeps. Her hands once warm, have to rest, her heart. Once full. Now at peace, a soul now soaring, Nancy Affran our dearest light who shone so bright, day and night.
            </p>
            <p>A mother&apos;s love, so pure and true, in every action, every word you knew. You nurtured us with tender grace and gave our world a warm embrace,
                Your laughter, a balm for weary days, your wisdom, a guide through life&apos;s maze. Your gentle touch, a soothing sound, comforted me when the world spun round. Soft whispers, lullabies so sweet. In dream, id hear your loving beat.
                A steady hand through every tide, with love so deep and strength so pure, she gave us all and asked no more. Her days ever so filled with selfless grace, in her embrace I found a home, with her we were never alone.
                Though I couldn&apos;t speak, you understood, my coos, cries and smiles, our special bond withstood. In my babble id converse, you&apos;d smile understanding every verse.
                Though twelve short months were our share, your love and kindness, a lifetime, ill declare. 
                </p>
            <p>Rest, dear Granma, your legacy stays.
                In every heartbeat, loves sways, i&apos;d forever miss you so dear, knowing you are watching and always near.</p>
