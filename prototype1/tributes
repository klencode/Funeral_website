            <h2 style="color: #3498db;">Tribute by Children</h2>
            <p>In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you. 1 Thessalonians
                6:18 (KJV)</p>
            <p>We are saddened by the passing of our beloved father but we are very thankful to God for granting him a
                fulfilled life. We are in tune with the hymnist in MHB 377 that “whatever my lot, thou has taught me to
                say it is well with my soul”.</p>
            <p>Daddy, we were fortunate to have you as our father. Growing up, we all witnessed your desire and focus on
                giving us a proper education. The inspection of our uniforms to check cleanliness after school to ensure
                that our focus was ultimately in the classroom.</p>
            <p>Daddy, you were a total disciplinarian. You shaped our lives with your regular behavioral checks and
                reminded us to never forget our roots and always be respectful and humble. By your hard work,
                compassion, and dedication, you demonstrated to us that anything is possible once you put your mind to
                it.</p>
            <p>Most of all, you were a loving father. You put in a lot of work to keep your children together. We fondly
                remember those Christmas days when we all sat around the round table in the compound and shared soft
                drinks and biscuits. Daddy, you taught us so much and we are very thankful for having you as our father.
            </p>
            <p>As difficult as we have to watch you go meet your maker, we are comforted that you are in a better place
                and nodding your head in approval. You may have gone but certainly not forgotten. Our goodbyes today are
                not forever and not the end but simply mean we would miss you till we meet again.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #3498db;">Tribute by In-Laws</h2>
            <p>To our beloved Father-in-law Welford Anum Mensah.</p>
            <p>Today, we celebrate the extraordinary life you lived. Marriage brings families together as expected but
                ours was not a mere saying but one born out of love and affection. Our father-in-law welcomed each one
                of us into the family without any reservations.</p>
            <p>He inspired us with his kindness, wisdom, and love. He was always willing and available to offer words of
                encouragement whenever needed. His presence was indeed felt in our lives. We will always remember all
                that you did for the family.</p>
            <p>He took keen interest in the welfare of his grandchildren, he showed them love and made them happy
                whenever they were with him. We are honored and privileged to have known such a great person like you.
            </p>
            <p>Although you are no longer with us physically, we take comfort in the memories we shared together. We are
                comforted knowing that you are in a better place away from all the tribulations on earth. You will
                forever remain in our hearts, daddy as we affectionately called you. We will cherish and always remember
                the time we spent with you. Rest in peace in the bosom of the Almighty God.</p>

        <!-- Tribute by Church -->
        <section class="tribute-section">
            <h2 style="color: #3498db;">Tribute by Church - Ebenezer Methodist Society, Dansoman Circuit</h2>
            <p>“Everything that happens in this world happens at the time God chooses. He sets the time for birth and
                the time for death..........” (Ecclesiastes 3:1&2 GNB)</p>
            <p>The late Bro. Welford Anum Mensah joined Ebenezer Methodist Church, in 2015 from Mt. Olivet Society. Upon
                joining the church, he joined Sis Ivy Otoo&apos;s Bible Class, now the Acts bible Class and immediately
                requested for a tithe book to enable him pay his tithes. Though he joined the church when he was in his
                old age, he was regular at church services.</p>
            <p>Bro. Welford Mensah was a simple and modest person, he was a man of few words and you would always find
                him seated quietly when he comes for church services. Not long after he joined the church, due to old
                age and health challenges, he was not able to make it for church services but the Rev Minister and
                Stewards visited him to pray for him and administer to him the communion and he was always looking
                forward to that visit.</p>
            <p>On Wednesday the 18th of September 2024, the Rev Minister and the steward visited him, administered to
                him the communion and prayed for him, then on Wednesday 25th of September 2024, the news of his death
                reached us. Little did they know that was the last time they were seeing Mr. Mensah.</p>
            <p>We offer our sincere condolences to his wife, children, siblings, family, friends, and associates and all
                who are closer to him. We believe Mr. Mensah is taking a well-deserved rest in the bosom of His creator
                where there is no more pain, no more sorrow and no more worries. Let us not weep as people without hope
                but rather rejoice with the belief that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will bring
                with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in Him. Farewell our beloved Bro. Welford Anum Mensah, and may
                your soul rest in perfect peace till we meet again.</p>

        <!-- Tribute by Grandchildren -->
        <section class="tribute-section">
            <h2 style="color: #3498db;">Tribute by Grandchildren and Great-Grandchildren</h2>
            <p>A tribute to our grandfather, a shining soul, with kindness in his heart and humor in his soul. He
                brightened lives, making our world whole. His love for the outdoors, a constant delight, inspired
                adventures, under sun-kissed light.</p>
            <p>Through diligent work, he showed us the way, to earn with pride, each and every day. His drive to
                provide, a noble quest, taught us self-reliance and doing our best. &apos;Make your own money,&apos; he&apos;d often
                say, &apos;Don&apos;t depend on others, find your own way.&apos; A valuable lesson we gratefully hold, empowering us to
                stand, young and bold.</p>
            <p>We&apos;re grateful for laughter, tears, and fun, for memories of him, forever won. His legacy of love,
                forever in our hearts, guides us forward, never to depart. Rest in peace, dear grandfather of ours. Your
                kindness, humor, and love forever shine.</p>
